\section{Introduction}
% At least one page, at most page and a half. 
Exogenous economics models are those that assume the economy is stable and operates in equilibrium, such that only external factors can cause a potential crash \citep{ganti_2019}. However, the real world reflects that a macro-economy can itself destabilize due to internal factors such as wage share, employment rate, and private debt, compounded by the systems put in place by governments to ensure stability \citep{minsky1992financial}. For this, R. M. Goodwin proposed an endogenous economics model in 1967 that, at its core, mimics Lotka-Volterra prey-predator dynamics \citep{goodwin1982growth}. The extension of Goodwin’s model by \citet{keen1995finance} focused on modeling Hayman Minsky’s “financial instability hypothesis”. In essence, Minsky argues that the economy can fall into a crisis given an accumulation of debt by the private sector\citep{minsky1992financial}. As considered by \citet{grasselli2012analysis,maheshwari2015empirical}, this Goodwin-Keen model looks into the impact of three parameters on a simplified macro-economy: employment rate ($\lambda$), wage share ($\omega$), and private debt ($d$) .

\section{Methodology}
This is where you write your mathematical definitions, or dataset acquistions, and or cleaning of data. 
At most two pages, at least 1 page.
\subsection{Data Processing}
\subsection{S.I.R. Model}
\subsection{Plot Construction}
\newpage
\section{Application}
You need to talk about the results of your model. 
\subsection{Simulation Study}
If your model or problem set has parameters your change, this is where you would write about it. 
Minimum 1 and a half pages. 

\section{Conclusion}
Housing Prices: Future projections show this, from the model. Then write about what the future results indicate. 
SIR Model: If you decrease the infection rate by 20\%, you will get a peak decrease of 15\%. 
Sport Statistics: This model indicates player outcomes for this and this team to win these type of games. 
This is half a page long.
