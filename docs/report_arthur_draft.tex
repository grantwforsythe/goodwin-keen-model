In every economy there exist many factors impacting potential long-term equilibria. Some, but not all, of these factors have been accounted for by various models. Here, we examine the subtle differences between the Goodwin and Goodwin-Keen models which seek to explain economic dynamics. To do so, the long-term equilibria are presented, and a brief parameter sensitivity study is conducted. The results of the study illustrate that the Goodwin model presents only one realistic equilibrium, that the non-trivial solution of the Goodwin-Keen model presents an extreme economic scenario, and that long-term economic equilibria are greatly impacted by the initial conditions of state variables. Our findings motivate the pursuit of a deeper understanding of economic dynamics, as it paves the way for better predictions for future economic events.

\section{Introduction}
% At least one page, at most page and a half.
% Goodwin Model Paragraph
\noindent Exogenous economics models are those that assume an economy is stable and operates in equilibrium, such that only external factors can cause a potential crash \citep{ganti_2019}. However, the real world reflects that a macro-economy can itself destabilize due to internal factors, such as wage share, employment rate, and private debt, compounded by the systems placed by governments to ensure stability \citep{minsky1992financial}. In 1967, R. M. Goodwin proposed an endogenous economics model that, at its core, mimics Lotka-Volterra prey-predator dynamics \citep{goodwin1982growth}. Although issues with this model have been observed since its conception \citep{harvie2000testing}, many still agree that the model holds value from a qualitative perspective due to its attention to the interplay and dynamic behaviour of internal economic factors \citep{flaschel2016mathematical}. 

% Minsky Hypothesis and the Goodwin-Keen Model Paragraph (TBD)
\noindent In 1992, Hyman Minsky hypothesized that economies can destabilize due to internal factors similar to those considered by Goodwin \citep{minsky1992financial}. Minsky's hypothesis, known as the \emph{Instability Hypothesis}, states that an economy can become fragile because capitalists are willing to incur credit-based debt in pursuit of capital gains. Minsky also identified some limitations of the Goodwin model such as accounting for long-term and short-term debts individually, the instability caused by income inequality, and stability due to government regulations \citep{minsky1992financial}. However, Minksy did not represent the hypothesis mathematically even though it was deemed significant by others in the field. Realizing its importance, Steve Keen \citep{keen1995finance} introduced its key ideas into the Goodwin model––resulting in the now-known Goodwin-Keen Model. 

% Purpose Paragraph
\noindent In isolation, these models exhibit sensible and closed-form solutions as presented by \citet{goodwin1982growth} and \citet{grasselli2012analysis}. It is of particular interest to understand the impact of Keen's addendum of Minsky's hypothesis to the predictive value of the model since, despite their shortcomings \citep{harvie2000testing, moura2013testing}, there is value in understanding the underlying notions of the economy upon which the models are based. As such, in this report, we examine Keen's introduction of private debt into Goodwin's original model.

% Closing Paragraph
\noindent Specifically, we take an in-depth look at the Goodwin model with respect to its long-term behaviour and stability. This is demonstrated both analytically, and corroborated through numerical methods. An equivalent analysis is performed on the Goodwin-Keen model. The results for each model are compared, focusing on their relative long-term predictive value. Finally, conclusive remarks are made based on the value of these models as potential, real-world, predictive tools.

\subsection{Goodwin Model}
The Goodwin model is described by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:goodwin} 
\begin{split}
    \dot{\lambda} &= \lambda \cdot \left( \frac{1-\omega}{\nu} - \alpha - \beta - \delta \right), \\
    \dot{\omega} &= \omega \cdot (\Phi(\lambda) - \alpha).
\end{split}
\end{equation}
In this model, $\lambda$ represents the fraction of employed workers, and $\omega$ represents the worker's wage share. The Jacobian matrix for the Goodwin system of equations presented as \eqref{eq:goodwin} is defined by
\begin{equation} \label{eq:goodwinJ}
\mathbf J =
\begin{bmatrix}
    \pdv{\lambda}\dot{\lambda} & \pdv{\omega}\dot{\lambda}\\[1ex]
    \pdv{\lambda}\dot{\omega} & \pdv{\omega}\dot{\omega}
\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}
This Jacobian matrix was symbolically determined using various methods (i.e. \texttt{solvers.solve}, \texttt{symbols}, \texttt{Matrix}) from the SymPy libary \citep{SymPy}.  The equilibrium points and the corresponding eigenvalues of $\mathbf J$ were also symbolically determined using these methods. To corroborate these results, the parameters in Table \ref{tab:parameters} were used to numerically solve the system. This was done using the \texttt{integrate.odeint} method from the SciPy library \citep{2020SciPy-NMeth}. Initial conditions to the system were selected based on \citet{grasselli2012analysis}. The Matplotlib \citep{matplotlib} graphic library was used to generate representative plots of the resulting numerical solution.

\subsection{Goodwin-Keen Model}
We consider the Goodwin-Keen model as the system of differential equations defined by 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:keen}
\begin{split}
    \dot{\lambda} &= \lambda \cdot \left( \frac{\kappa(\pi)}{\nu} - \alpha - \beta - \delta \right),\\
    \dot{\omega} &= \omega \cdot (\Phi(\lambda) - \alpha),\\
    \dot{d} &= d\cdot\left(r-\frac{\kappa(\pi)}{\nu}+\delta\right)+\kappa(\pi)-(1-\omega), \\
    \pi &= 1-\omega-rd.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Where the newly introduce variable $d$ represents the debt ratio of the economy. Additionally, a nonlinear increasing function $\kappa(\pi)$ now represents the rate of new investment in the economy \citep{grasselli2012analysis}, and $\pi$ represents the net profits share\footnote{Note $\pi$ is an implicit part of the model and does not represent one of the model's state variables. It represents the net profit made from capital investments \citep{grasselli2012analysis}, and also serves to simplify the analysis.}. The Jacobian matrix for the system is now defined by 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:keenJ}
\mathbf J =
\begin{bmatrix}
    \pdv{\lambda}\dot{\lambda} & \pdv{\omega}\dot{\lambda} & \pdv{d}\dot{\lambda}\\[1ex]
    \pdv{\lambda}\dot{\omega} & \pdv{\omega}\dot{\omega} & \pdv{\omega}\dot{\omega}\\[1ex]
    \pdv{\lambda}\dot{d} & \pdv{\omega}\dot{d} & \pdv{d}\dot{d}
\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}
Given the increased complexity of this model, equilibrium points were determined numerically for a variety of initial conditions using the \texttt{integrate.odeint} method from the SciPy library \citep{2020SciPy-NMeth} and simulating for 1000 steps. The closed-form Jacobian matrix was determined using the SymPy library \citep{SymPy}, and its eigenvalues were then determined using the SymPy \texttt{eigenvects} method. A \emph{region of convergence} study was then performed on this model using the parameters in Table \ref{tab:parameters}. Long-term model convergence was asserted by verifying that the real part of the eigenvalues of \eqref{eq:keenJ}, for various initial conditions, had a value less than zero. All results were plotted using the Matplotlib \citep{matplotlib} graphic library.

\subsection{The Goodwin Model}
The following is a detailed study on the system behaviour demonstrated by the Goodwin model. We begin by noting that in \eqref{eq:goodwin} the Philips curve $\Phi(\lambda)$ has not been explicitly defined. When the model was proposed \citep{goodwin1982growth}, $\Phi(\lambda)$ was assumed to be a linear function of employment rate. This would mean that a higher fraction of employment leads to a rising wage share. Nevertheless, \citet{goodwin1982growth} admitted that this was an empirical and disputable assumption. On that account, \citet{keen1995finance} proposed \eqref{eq:keenPhil} as a more realistic model. The introduced function models a worker population more willing to accept wage cuts at higher levels of unemployment (i.e. lower $\lambda$). Conversely, as employment rates increase, workers will demand real wages that asymptotically increase (i.e. $\lambda\to1$). This function was also adopted by \citet{grasselli2012analysis} and incorporated into the Goodwin model.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:keenPhil}
    \Phi(\lambda) = \frac{\Phi_1}{(1-\lambda)^2}-\Phi_0.
\end{equation}
Thus, from \eqref{eq:goodwinJ}, it follows that
\begin{equation} \label{eq:jac_good}
    \mathbf J = \begin{bmatrix}
        \frac{1-\omega}{\nu}-\alpha-\beta-\delta & -\frac{\lambda}{\nu}\\[1ex]
        \frac{2\Phi_1\omega}{(1-\lambda)^3} & \frac{\Phi_1}{(1-\lambda)^2}-\Phi_0-\alpha
\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}
The eigenvalues of \eqref{eq:jac_good} determine the nature of the stability of the model at equilibrium. As it turns out, the Goodwin model has two equilibrium points besides the trivial solution $(\lambda^\ast,\omega^\ast)=(0, 0)$. These include
\begin{equation} \label{eq:goodwin_eqm}
\begin{split}
    (\lambda_\pm^\ast, \omega^\ast) &= \left(1\pm\sqrt{\frac{\Phi_1}{\alpha + \Phi_0}},\quad  1-\nu\cdot(\alpha + \beta + \delta)\right)
\end{split}.
\end{equation}
We first must note that all the parameters in \eqref{eq:goodwin_eqm} are positive such that $\sqrt{\frac{\Phi_1}{\alpha + \Phi_0}} \in\mathbb R > 0$. Moreover, $\lambda$ is restricted to the bounded interval $[0, 1]$. This means the only economically feasible equilibrium pair is $(\lambda_-^\ast, \omega^\ast)$, since $\lambda_+^\ast$ is inevitably greater than unity. As $(\lambda_-^\ast, \omega^\ast)$ is the only meaningful equilibrium point, we simply denote it as $(\lambda^\ast, \omega^\ast)$. The valid equilibrium pair can be incorporated into \eqref{eq:jac_good} and yield the following eigenvalues
\begin{equation} \label{eq:goodwin_eig}
    \pm\sqrt 2\cdot\sqrt{\xi_1 - \xi_2},
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
    \xi_1 &= \frac{\Phi_0 + \alpha}{\nu} + \frac{\sqrt{\Phi_1\cdot(\Phi_0 + \alpha)}(\Phi_0+\alpha)(\alpha+\beta+\delta)}{\Phi_1},\\
    \xi_2 &= \frac{\sqrt{\Phi_1\cdot(\Phi_0 + \alpha)}(\Phi_0 + \alpha)}{\Phi_1\nu} + (\Phi_0+\alpha)(\alpha+\beta+\delta).
    \end{split}
\end{equation*}
These expressions hold an integral detail about the nature of the equilibrium points. Namely, whether the solution is cyclic in nature. Clearly, if $\xi_1>\xi_2$ then the eigenvalues are solely real and must necessarily diverge (since one of the eigenvalues is strictly positive). However, if $\xi_1<\xi_2$ we can guarantee that both eigenvalues 1) will yield a converging solution, and 2) said solution will be cyclical in nature. To proceed, the parameter values defined in Table \ref{tab:parameters} are introduced. Evaluating expression \eqref{eq:goodwin_eig} yields the (approximate) imaginary eigenvalues
\begin{equation} \label{eq:goodwin_eig_eval}
    \pm\num{0.747558}\sqrt{2}i.
\end{equation}
With these parameters we can also determine the equilibrium pair to be approximately
\begin{equation}
    (\lambda^\ast, \omega^\ast) = (0.968612, 0.835000).
\end{equation}
\noindent
To verify the aforementioned results, the system was numerically solved. Figure \ref{fig:goodwin} shows the behaviour of the model for 100 steps (equivalenet to 100 years). 
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includesvg[scale=0.7]{goodwin_model.svg}
    \caption{Goodwin Model Behaviour.}
    \label{fig:goodwin}
\end{figure}
\noindent With the selected parameters, the model must be convergent and exhibit a cyclical behaviour. This behaviour is clearly demonstrated by the phase portrait depicted in Figure \ref{fig:goodwin_phase}. Here, the model was simulated for 1000 steps, and it is evident that the system, while not static, had reached a form of equilibrium. This plot also shows the value of the equilibrium pair $(\lambda^\ast, \omega^\ast)$ relative to the equilibrium orbit of the system.

    \centering
    \includesvg[scale=0.7]{goodwin_phase.svg}
    \caption{Goodwin Equilibrium Phase Diagram.}
    \label{fig:goodwin_phase}
\end{figure}

\subsection{The Goodwin-Keen Model}
The Jacobian matrix for the Goodwin-Keen model makes use of both \eqref{eq:keenPhil} and 
\begin{equation*} \label{eq:keenKappa}
    \kappa=\kappa(\pi) = \kappa_0 + \kappa_1\mathrm e^{\kappa_2\pi}.
\end{equation*}
Before we present the matrix, we note the use of the notational simplification
\begin{equation*}
    \kappa^\prime = -\pdv{\kappa}{\omega} = -\frac{1}{r}\pdv{\kappa}{d} = \kappa_1\kappa_2\mathrm e^{\kappa_2\pi}.
\end{equation*}
Thus the Jacobian matrix for the Goodwin-Keen model is given by
\begin{equation} \label{eq:jac_keen}
    \mathbf J = %
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \frac{\kappa-\nu(\alpha+\beta+\delta)}{\nu} & -\frac{\lambda\kappa^\prime}{\nu} & -\frac{\lambda r\kappa^\prime}{\nu} \\[0.5em]
        \frac{2\Phi_1\omega}{(1-\lambda)^3} & \frac{\Phi_1}{(1-\lambda)^2}-\Phi_0-\alpha & 0\\[0.5em]
        0 & \frac{(d-\nu)\kappa^\prime+\nu}{\nu} & \frac{r\cdot(d-\nu)\kappa^\prime}{\nu}+ \delta + r
    \end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}
The numerical solution provided values for the equilibrium points. One illustrative example of the solution of the model is shown in Figures \ref{fig:keen} and \ref{fig:keen_phase} using the parameter values in Table \ref{tab:parameters} and initial conditions used by \citet{grasselli2012analysis}.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includesvg[scale=0.7]{keen_model.svg}
    \caption{Goodwin-Keen Model Behaviour.}
    \label{fig:keen}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includesvg[scale=0.7]{keen_phase.svg}
    \caption{Goodwin-Keen Equilibrium Phase Diagram.}
    \label{fig:keen_phase}
\end{figure}
\noindent The result of the simulation study for the region of convergence of this model are consolidated in Figure \ref{fig:keen_study}.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includesvg[scale=0.7]{keen_study.svg}
    \caption{Goodwin-Keen Region of Convergence.}
    \label{fig:keen_study}
\end{figure}
\noindent This figure shows that, of the total 1000 simulations performed (represented as each point in the plot) only 102 sets of initial conditions converged, and the remaining 898 did not. Moreover, all converging events lead to the same equilibrium point
\begin{equation}
    (\lambda^\ast, \omega^\ast, d^\ast) = (0.968612, 0.86053, 0.070191).
\end{equation}
The simulations that lead to a diverging event yielded floating-point values where $\lambda$ and $\omega$ were consistently on the order of \num{e-20} (or lower) and $d$ on the order of \num{e19} (or higher). This suggests that another ``equilibrium point'' can be found at
\begin{equation}
    (\lambda^\times, \omega^\times, d^\times) = (0, 0, +\infty).
\end{equation}

\subsection{Model Comparison} 
It is known that the Goodwin model sufferers from many limitations \citep{harvie2000testing, moura2013testing}. Nevertheless, the model has persisted. The Goodwin model supplies economists with insight into the predator-prey relationships between capitalists and workers. \citep{goodwin1982growth}. We've concluded from our study that this model only has one economically realistic equilibrium. More importantly, this equilibrium can only be divergent or oscillatory. This feature has been heavily criticized since, in reality, economies are liable to failures. The Goodwin model does not consider such a scenario, as it does not describe the economy in sufficient detail. However, what it does offer is a concise formulation and a stepping-stone for more complex and accurate models.

Such is the case for the Goodwin-Keen model. What Steve Keen accomplished was the persistence of the prey-predator nature of the original model with the possibility of exhibiting an economic failure scenario \citep{keen1995finance}. Here $(\lambda^\times, \omega^\times, d^\times)$ represents this critical contribution to the overall model. Unlike with the Goodwin model, where the trivial solution holds no economic value, the divergent solution for the Goodwin-Keen model describes the real scenario of an economy with maximum debt, absolute unemployment, an no wage share for the working population \citep{minsky1992financial}. Our simulation study also shows that, \emph{ceteris paribus}, the nature of the long-term equilibrium of the economy is dependant on the initial conditions of the state variables $\lambda$, $\omega$, and $d$. That is, economies described by the same parameters can fail or stabilize solely as a results of where they start.

\section{Conclusion}
Throughout this report, the Goodwin and Goodwin-Keen models have been described qualitatively, and presented mathematically. The behaviours of the economic models have been explored numerically and analytically. The tendency of the Goodwin model to converge to an oscillatory equilibrium state or diverge has been demonstrated. The Goodwin-Keen model's more realistic feature of representing an economic collapse has been investigated, and a realistic simulation has been performed. A thorough comparison of the models has interpreted theor behaviours. This study has concluded that the Goodwin model produces unrealistic long-term behaviour that cannot be used to accurately describe an economy. It has, however, led to many more realistic models based on the original predator-prey dynamic such as the Goodwin-Keen model. As demonstrated in this report, Keen's improved model can reasonably simulate a market crash. The ability to simulate and predict an incoming recession or depression gives governments invaluable foresight. This allows policy-makers to enact regulations to avoid, or at the very least, curb the severity of the market-crash. [want to add a sentence that relates to the effect an economic collapse can have on an individual].
