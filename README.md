## Abstract
In every economy there exist many factors impacting long-term equilibria, some of which have been accounted for by various models.  Here, we examine the differences between the Goodwin and Goodwin-Keen models which seek to explain economic dynamics.  To do so, we present long-term equilibria and conduct a brief sensitivity study. The results illustrate that the Goodwin model presents only one realistic equilibrium, that the Goodwin-Keen modelâ€™s non-trivial solution is an extreme economic scenario, and that the long-term economic equilibria are impacted by the initial state variable conditions.  These findings motivate the pursuit of a deeper understanding of economic ynamics, as it paves the way for better predictions of economic events

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python version: 3.8
	
## Setup
It is a best practice to run program files in a virtual environment as
it allows the program to run with it's own separate dependencies.

To initialize a virtual environment use the command:
```console
cd path_to_project/
python -m venv .venv
```
To activate the environment:

Mac/Linux:
```console
source my_env/bin/activate
```
Windows:
```console
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
To verify that your virtual environment is activated, your command line
should look like the following.
```console
(.venv) C:\Users\name\Desktop\Repos\math3mb3>
```
Then, to install the required dependices, run the following command.
```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To deactivate simply use the command:
```console
deactivate
```
