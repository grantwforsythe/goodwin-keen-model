## Setup
It is a best practice to run program files in a virtual environment as
it allows the program to run with it's own separate dependencies.

To initialize a virtual environment use the command:
```
cd path_to_project/
python -m venv .venv
```
To activate the environment:

Mac/Linux:
```
source my_env/bin/activate
```
Windows:
```
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
To verify that your virtual environment is activated, your command line
should look like the following.
```
(.venv) C:\Users\name\Desktop\Repos\math3mb3>
```
Then, to install the required dependices, run the following command.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To deactivate simply use the command:
```
deactivate
```
